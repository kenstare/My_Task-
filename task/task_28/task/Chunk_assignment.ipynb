    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Explore how embeddings capture semantic similarity between different texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the sample sentences below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sentences = [\n",
    "    \"The dog is playing in the park\",\n",
    "    \"A puppy is running outside\",\n",
    "    \"The cat is sleeping on the couch\",\n",
    "    \"Python is a programming language\",\n",
    "    \"Machine learning models need data\",\n",
    "    \"I love coding in Python\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate embeddings for all sentences using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate similarity scores between:\n",
    "   - Sentence 1 and all others\n",
    "   - Sentence 4 and all others\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Answer these questions:\n",
    "   - Which sentences are most similar to \"The dog is playing in the park\"?\n",
    "   - Which sentences are most similar to \"Python is a programming language\"?\n",
    "   - What similarity threshold would you use to filter unrelated content?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
